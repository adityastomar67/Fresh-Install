======================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Please see the man page for considerable more documentation and examples.

You may read the man page without installing the package by one of these
commands:

- Show it in man:

    $ man ./man/pass.1

- Produce an HTML page:

    $ groff -mandoc -T html ./man/pass.1 > pass-man-page.html

- Produce a PDF document:

    $ groff -mandoc ./man/pass.1 > pass-man-page.ps
    $ ps2pdf pass-man-page.ps
